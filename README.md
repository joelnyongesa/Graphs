# Graphs

In this repository, I try to understand graphs in depth, and also using graphs to develop a social network where one can:

1. Add people (nodes) to the social network.

2. Add friendships between people (edges between nodes).

3. Remove edges between people (end friendships).

4. Remove nodes from the social network (Revoke accounts)
